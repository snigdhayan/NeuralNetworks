# NeuralNetworks

This repository contains my experiments with neural networks. 

1. In the 'Tensorflow' directory there is a tensorflow + keras based deep neural network that learns to forecast from a handicrafted time series dataset. 
2. In the 'Ludwig' directory there is a simple https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig based approach to analyze the breast cancer dataset 'breast_cancer_dataset.csv'. Ludwig is a low-code framework that uses tensorflow underneath. To run the script 'BreastCancerAnalysisViaLudwig.py' one must install Ludwig and associated dependencies (e.g., I created a conda environment with python=3.6 for this purpose). Moreover, it assumes the existence of data 'breast_cancer_dataset.csv' and model definition (LudwigModelDefinitionFile.yml) in the working directory.
3. In the 'FastAI' directory there is a jupyter notebook that analyzes the breast cancer dataset 'breast_cancer_dataset.csv' based on https://www.fast.ai/. Since it is a tabular dataset, I used the tabular learner that uses the PyTorch framework underneath. 
4. In the 'Tensorflow-Quantum' directory I compared the performance (time + accuracy) of a quantum neural network with that of a comparable classical neural network on MNIST dataset after 2 epochs following this tutorial: https://www.tensorflow.org/quantum/tutorials/mnist I conducted the experiment in a docker container on my Windows 10 Home laptop. I added the dockerfile based on which the docker image is built. The breast cancer dataset is then analyzed via tensorflow-quantum using the ideas of amplitude encoding and binary encoding.
