# NeuralNetworks

This repository contains my experiments with neural networks. 

1. In the 'Tensorflow' directory there is a tensorflow + keras based deep neural network that learns to forecast from a handicrafted time series dataset. Moreover, there is an autoencoder based approach to detect breast cancer (malignant cases) as anomalies among normal cases (benign cases). 
2. In the 'Ludwig' directory there is a simple https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig based approach to analyze the breast cancer dataset 'breast_cancer_dataset.csv'. Ludwig is a low-code framework that uses tensorflow underneath. To run the script 'BreastCancerAnalysisViaLudwig.py' one must install Ludwig and associated dependencies (e.g., I created a conda environment with python=3.6 for this purpose). Moreover, it assumes the existence of the dataset 'breast_cancer_dataset.csv' and the model definition 'LudwigModelDefinitionFile.yml' in the working directory.
3. In the 'FastAI' directory there is a jupyter notebook that analyzes the breast cancer dataset 'breast_cancer_dataset.csv' based on https://www.fast.ai/. Since it is a tabular dataset, I used the tabular learner that uses the PyTorch framework underneath. 
4. In the 'Tensorflow-Quantum' directory there is a comparison between the performances (time + accuracy) of a quantum neural network and a comparable classical neural network following this tutorial: https://www.tensorflow.org/quantum/tutorials/mnist. Furthermore, the tensorflow-quantum framework is applied to analyze the dataset 'breast_cancer_dataset.csv' using the ideas of amplitude encoding and binary encoding. The experiment was conducted in a docker container during a quantum computing hackathon that I had organized. I have included the dockerfile for transparency.
