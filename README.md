# NeuralNetworks

This repository contains my experiments with neural networks. Currently there is a TF + Keras based deep neural network that learns to forecast from a handicrafted time series dataset. In the 'Ludwig' directory there is a simple Uber Ludwig based approach to analyze breast cancer. To run the script 'BreastCancerAnalysisViaLudwig.py' one must install Ludwig and associated dependencies (e.g., I created a separate conda environment with python=3.6); moreover, it assumes the existence of data (breast_cancer_dataset.csv) and model definition (LudwigModelDefinitionFile.yml) in the current directory.
